# Reducer
* A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state. It "reduces" those two arguments to one output:

`reducer = (previousState, action) => nextState`

***Render props pattern takes a function that does some logic before it renders***

**Hooks are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy, reusing state in a simple way**
