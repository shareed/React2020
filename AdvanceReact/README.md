## Class Components
*Use classes to build out components. Class Components have been a big part of the React ecosystem because they brought a lot of functionality that we normally didn’t get with the React API when using function components. Now with hooks, that functionality is available in function components. However, a LOT of projects will still have class components in them, and we need to be prepared to work with classes when we see them.*

- [ ] Crate Class components, and use a class component to render some state data to the DOM
- [ ] Share data between components using state and props
- [ ] Respond to events triggered by user interaction and handle user input via forms in React


## The React Lifecycle
*Every component in React has what we call a lifecycle. The Lifecycle is a a part of how our components operate under the hood. Being able to demonstrate understanding of the React Component Lifecycle by knowing how to use a few of the “Methods” that are provided by it, will help you understand how and why react behaves the way it does at times.*

- [ ] The three phases of the React Component Lifecycle
- [ ] The `constructor` and `render` methods do and what their place is in the React Component Lifecycle
- [ ] Use the `componentDidMount` function to set a component's state post render


## Composing and Sharing Non-Visual Behavior

- [ ] Define stateful logic
- [ ] Apply non-visual behavior (stateful logic) with custom hooks
- [ ] Compose hooks in a custom hook to extend multiple pieces of stateful logic


## Testing Web Applications

- [ ] automated testing
- [ ] how to write unit tests with Jest and react-testing-library.
- [ ] Explain what automated testing is and its importance
- [ ] Use react-testing-library for testing react components
- [ ] Use react-testing-library to test user interactions with fireEvent
